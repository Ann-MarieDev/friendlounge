**2. User Profile Management
Profile Creation: Allow users to create, update, and delete profiles (name, bio, photo).
Profile Customization: Allow users to add customizations (backgrounds, profile themes, etc.).
Privacy Settings: Users should be able to manage privacy (who can see their profile, posts, etc.).
**3. Database Design
User Table: Store user information (username, email, hashed password, etc.).
Posts Table: Allow users to post content (text, images, videos).
Friends Table: Manage user connections (friends/following).
Likes/Comments Table: Users can like or comment on posts.
Messages Table: Allow users to send private messages.
Activity Table: Track user activities (login history, posts, etc.).
**4. Post System
Create Posts: Users should be able to create posts with text, images, and videos.
Post Feed: Build a system that displays posts from friends or followed users.
Like/Dislike: Implement a like/dislike functionality for posts.
Comments: Allow users to comment on posts.
Post Editing & Deletion: Users should be able to edit and delete their posts.
Post Visibility: Allow users to control post visibility (public, private, friends only).
**5. User Interaction
Following/Friends System: Users can follow others or send friend requests.
Friend requests, accept/reject flow.
Follow/unfollow.
Notifications System: Users receive notifications for friend requests, new messages, likes, comments, etc.
Email or in-app notifications.
Direct Messaging System: Allow users to send private messages to each other.
Implement chat rooms or one-on-one messaging.
Support for media (images, files) in messages.
Activity Feed: A feed showing updates from followed users or friends.
**6. Content Moderation
Reporting System: Allow users to report inappropriate content or behavior.
Content Filtering: Implement content filtering for posts, comments, and messages (e.g., banning offensive words).
Admin Panel: A backend panel for admins to view reports, block users, and manage content.
Blocked Users: Allow users to block others, preventing interactions.
**7. Search Functionality
Search Users: Allow users to search for other users by name, email, or tags.
Search Posts: Users should be able to search for posts by keywords or tags.
Search Activity: Implement search for specific user activity or content.
**8. Real-time Features
Live Chat: Implement WebSockets (or libraries like Socket.io) for real-time messaging.
Live Notifications: Use WebSockets to notify users of new likes, comments, or messages in real-time.
Real-time Feed: Implement a live updating newsfeed.
**9. Media Handling
Image/Video Upload: Users should be able to upload images or videos to posts, profile photos, etc.
File Storage: Set up a cloud storage solution (e.g., AWS S3) or local server to store media files.
Compression: Compress images and videos to optimize performance and load times.
**10. Backend Framework & API
Backend Framework: Choose a backend framework (e.g., Node.js with Express, Django, Flask, Ruby on Rails, etc.).
API Development: Design and implement RESTful or GraphQL APIs for the frontend to communicate with the backend.
Rate Limiting: Protect your APIs from abuse (limit the number of requests a user can make in a given time period).
API Documentation: Document your API (using tools like Swagger or Postman).
**11. Scalability & Performance
Database Scaling: Consider sharding or partitioning databases for larger user bases.
Caching: Implement caching (e.g., Redis) to store frequently accessed data (like user profiles, posts).
Load Balancing: Use load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple servers.
File Caching: Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for storing and delivering images and videos.
**12. Security
Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive user data like passwords and messages.
HTTPS: Ensure all traffic is encrypted via SSL/TLS (HTTPS).
SQL Injection Prevention: Use prepared statements or ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to prevent SQL injection.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention: Sanitize input fields to prevent malicious code execution.
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Implement CSRF tokens to prevent unauthorized requests.
**13. Analytics & Tracking
User Analytics: Track how users are interacting with your platform (number of posts, likes, comments, etc.).
Event Tracking: Track specific user actions (logins, posts, etc.) using tools like Google Analytics or custom logging.
Performance Monitoring: Use tools like New Relic or Datadog to monitor backend performance.
**14. Testing & Quality Assurance
Unit Testing: Write tests for backend code to ensure functionality (using frameworks like Jest, Mocha, or PyTest).
Integration Testing: Ensure different parts of the system (API, database, authentication) work well together.
Load Testing: Use tools like Apache JMeter or Locust to simulate user traffic and ensure the system can handle large amounts of users.
**15. Deployment
Backend Server: Deploy your backend on a cloud platform like AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean.
CI/CD: Set up continuous integration/continuous deployment pipelines for automatic deployment.
Monitoring & Logging: Set up logging (e.g., with tools like Loggly, or ELK stack) and monitoring for system health.
Optional Advanced Features
Trending Topics/Hashtags: Allow posts to be tagged with hashtags and show trending content.
User Verification: Provide account verification for high-profile users.
Gamification: Add badges, achievements, or leaderboards to encourage user engagement.
